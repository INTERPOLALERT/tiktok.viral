## 🔒 Staged Funding Safety Mechanism

### How It Works

1. **Campaign Setup**
   - Creator defines total goal (e.g., $10,000)
   - Divides into milestones (e.g., 10 stages of $1,000 each)
   - Required to deposit PLS per stage (equal to stage amount)

2. **Investor Contribution**
   - Investors contribute PLS to campaign
   - Funds held in escrow by smart contract
   - Visible milestone progress

3. **Stage Release**
   - Creator submits proof of milestone completion
   - Verification happens (on-chain data, voting, or oracle)
   - If verified: Funds released + creator deposit unlocked
   - If failed: Automatic refund to investors + deposit returned

4. **Complete Safety**
   - Creator has "skin in the game" via deposits
   - Investors protected by stage-by-stage verification
   - Transparent on-chain tracking
   - Automated refunds if project fails

### Example Flow
```
Campaign: $10,000 goal, 10 milestones

Stage 1 ($1,000):
├─ Creator deposits $1,000 security
├─ Investors contribute $1,000
├─ Milestone completed & verified ✓
├─ $1,000 released to creator
└─ Creator deposit unlocked

Stage 2 ($1,000):
├─ Creator deposits $1,000 security
├─ Investors contribute $1,000
├─ Milestone failed ✗
├─ $1,000 refunded to investors
└─ Creator deposit returned

...repeat for remaining stages...
```

## 📊 Economic Model

### Revenue Structure
- **Creation Fees**: 100% burned (not platform revenue)
- **Contribution Fees**: 1% burned, 99% to campaign
- **Success Fees**: 1% platform revenue, 0.5% burned, 98.5% to creator

### Burn Economics

**Daily Projections (at scale):**
- 100 campaigns created → 2,500 PLS burned
- $100K contribution volume → 500 PLS burned
- **Total: 3,000 PLS burned daily**

**Annual Impact:**
- ~1,000,000 PLS permanently removed from circulation
- Measurable deflationary effect on supply
- Benefits all PLS holders
